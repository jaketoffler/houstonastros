To use this clustering algorithm, you'll need to first set up the environment.  You'll need to download Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

Download clusters.py and requirements.txt from this Github repository (https://github.com/jaketoffler/houstonastros/tree/master/Clustering) and place them in the same directory as the raw pitcher data file.

Then in bash (Terminal for Macs or Command Prompt for Windows) navigate to the directory where these files are stored.  Run the following command:

pip install requirements.txt

Your environment is now set up.  To run the application, run the following command:

python cluster.py [NAME OF RAW CSV FILE]

A new CSV called pitch_clusters.csv will be created in that directory that is identical to the input CSV with the exception of an additional column representing the predicted labels.
